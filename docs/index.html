It was during this era that China commanded influence of much of East Asia, Vietnam, and Myanmar to the south, while also expanding its sphere of control to the Turks in the west. Yet, the reign of the Ming dynasty has come and gone. What remains, however, is the spectacular architecture produced during this time. Builders of the period made use of existing techniques but also incorporated brick into its great walls and palaces. <br> <br> Here are some examples of the first batch of Ming Architecture on the protected relics list. </p> <div id="image-wall"></div> </div> </div>   <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-lg-6"> <h3>A sketch in region</h3> <p>Geologically, China could be divided into five areas: <strong style="background-color:#ffffb2">North China</strong>, <strong style="background-color:#fd8d3c">South Central</strong>, <strong style="background-color:#983530">Northwest</strong>, <strong style="background-color:#f03b20">Southwest</strong> and <strong style="background-color:#feb24c">East</strong>. If we see the map below in region, we could find that the architecture cultural relics are mainly in the intersect between North, Northwest and South Central. <br> <br> The centralized relics in Shannxi, Henan and Shanxi also revealed the choices of dynasties's capital city. China has a vast territory since ancient times, and it is more difficult to manage. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the capital in a place with a middle position, which is conducive to the management of the country. In addition, the ancient traffic is backward, the waterway is the most convenient transportation route, and the strategic significance of Shaanxi and Henan is close to the Yellow River. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-lg-6"> <button id="show-province" class="button-big">Relics in province</button> <button id="draw-map" class="button-big">Relics with map</button> <button id="draw-map-region" class="button-big">Relics in region</button> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-lg-8"> <div id="map_chart"></div> </div> </div>  <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-lg-6"> <h3>Feeling relics density</h3> <div id="graph"></div> <p>Here we measuring the density in two ways, firstly measure it in province population. <br> <br> The Heihe-Tengchong line could also display the trend.
